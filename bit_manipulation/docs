Left shift operators :

Syntax :

A << x
What does A Â« x mean :

A << x implies shifting the bits of A to the left by x positions.
The first x bits are lost this way. The last x bits have 0. Example : lets say

                A = 29 ( 11101 ) and x = 2,
                so A << 2 means
                     0 0 1 1 1 0 1 << 2
                     =============  ------> this sequence of digit shifts to the
                                            left by 2 positions
                    ----------------
                     1 1 1 0 1 0 0  = 116
A << x is equal to multiplication by pow(2, x). Think why.
1 << x is equal to pow(2, x).

x & (x-1) will clear the lowest set bit of x
x & ~(x-1) extracts the lowest set bit of x (all others are clear).
           Pretty patterns when applied to a linear sequence.
x & (x + (1 << n)) = x, with the run of set bits (possibly length 0) starting at
                        bit n cleared.
x & ~(x + (1 << n)) = the run of set bits (possibly length 0) in x,
                      starting at bit n.
x | (x + 1) = x with the lowest cleared bit set.
x | ~(x + 1) = extracts the lowest cleared bit of x (all others are set).
x | (x - (1 << n)) = x, with the run of cleared bits (possibly length 0)
                        starting at bit n set.
x | ~(x - (1 << n)) = the lowest run of cleared bits (possibly length 0) in x,
                      starting at bit n are the only clear bits.
